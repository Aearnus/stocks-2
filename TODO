Things that still have to be done:

* Add the history graph to stocks on main page
* Add the history graph to stocks on stock page
* Add an interface to properly sell shares
* Add an interface to properly buy shares
* Touch up the interface to create a company
* Add to the stock JSON object to allow partial sales
* Add a username/password alongside the ID token system (use the usernames/passwords as a private key to encrypt the ID?)
