Things that still have to be done:

* Add to the stock JSON object to allow partial sales
* Manage your own business
* Special stocks
* Cancel button on stock orders
* Worthless capitalist trash tab
* HTTPS
? Add a username/password alongside the ID token system (use the usernames/passwords as a private key to encrypt the ID?)
