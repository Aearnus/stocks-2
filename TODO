Things that still have to be done:

* Fix up the stock page and make it look better
* Manage your own business
* Touch up the interface to properly sell shares
* Touch up the interface to properly buy shares
* More stock browsing
* Special stocks
* Fix stock change counters
* Worthless capitalist trash tab
? Add to the stock JSON object to allow partial sales
? Add a username/password alongside the ID token system (use the usernames/passwords as a private key to encrypt the ID?)
